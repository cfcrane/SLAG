#Scripts to analyze output or job statistics for localassembly1115.pl
These Perl scripts were written for various purposes, but most of them have contributed to a manuscript, 
"SLAG: A Program for Seeded Local Assembly of Genes in Complex Genomes", which has been submitted to Molecular
Ecology Resources.  The purpose of each script is usually stated in a line that begins "#This script ", so one
can grep 'his scr' *pl to see them all at once.  We expect to add more scripts to this directory.
