## Vmatch is the default aligner used to find reads.
# 'l' determines how long the alignment must be. Increasing 'l' will make the
# search more stringent, lowering it will find more reads.
# 'e' determines how many errors are allowed. Increasing 'e' will find more
# reads, but also make Vmatch take longer to run.

## Before the first round, if a taboo_file has been supplied, it will be used as a query to remove reads that match it before the recursive contig building begins.

## In the first round, reads are aligned against the probe. Because this is a
## search for homologous reads, the matches should be allowed to be shorter and
## more error-prone than when searching for reads to extend the contigs.

# If the probe is a protein, it is indexed and the reads are used as queries.
[Vmatch_protein_init]
l=45

# If the probe is DNA, it is used as a query against the indexed reads.
# Searching the read index is much faster than using the reads as queries.
# Because DNA probes are most likely only going to be used in situations where
# close homology is expected, longer initial matches may be desired than with
# a protein probe.

## During recursion rounds, assembled contigs are aligned to the indexed reads
## to find reads that might allow longer contigs to be assembled.

## Found reads will sometimes be assembled into a contig that is not homologous
## to the probe, and SRAssembler will extend this contig along with the others.
## The reads found during this extension will slow the assembly step, and can
## even prevent the assembly of correct homologous contigs. During cleaning
## rounds, contigs and reads that are not relevant to the probe are removed.

## First the assembled contigs are aligned to the probe sequence.

# After irrelevant contigs have been removed, the found reads pool is aligned
# against the remaining contigs to identify the relevant reads. Consider making
# 'l' at least half the average length of your reads. You can also set "l=0" to
# require the entire read length to match an assembled contig.

## The assemblers have parameters that can be adjusted to change their tendency
## to assemble contigs in the face of uncertainty. You may use other parameters
## than the ones shown here. Check the assembler manuals for more information.
